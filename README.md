# StoreFront
This is the Frontend of a e-commerce store front. The backend for this can be found here: [StoreFront API](https://github.com/jman19/storeApi).  

The Frontend is written in TypeScript and uses the Angular framework. SASS (.scss) is used for styling the web app

# Dependencies 
angular cli

# How to Run Locally
1) clone the project
2) cd into the folder
3) ng serve

the StoreFront should now be accessible http://localhost:4200/
Note that in order to access the full site functionality locally you must also have the StoreFront API running locally as well
